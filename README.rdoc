CragView is a rails-based open-source database of climbing areas documented with Google Streetview.
The project utilizes Omniauth2 to find users' Google+ account information and
PicasaWebService API to locate panoramas that they have uploaded to Google Maps.

The "locator" feature allows users to drop a "Pegman" to any Streetview in Google's database.

Crag entries are displayed with their respective Streetviews and helpful info about climbing here.
